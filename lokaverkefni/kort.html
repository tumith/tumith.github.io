            <p id="modal__desc"><img class="sosmynd" src="5sos.jpg"> 5 Seconds of Summer (often abbreviated as 5SOS) are an Australian pop rock band from Sydney, New South Wales, formed in 2011. The group were originally YouTube celebrities, posting videos of themselves covering songs from various artists during 2011 and early 2012. They rose to international fame while touring with One Direction on their Take Me Home Tour.
            In early 2014, the band released "She Looks So Perfect" as its debut single, which topped the charts in Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and the United Kingdom. The self-titled debut studio album was released in June 2014, which peaked at number one in 11 countries and followed by a live album titled LiveSOS. The band released their second album Sounds Good Feels Good in October 2015 and followed up with the release of a live documentary DVD called How Did We End Up Here.
            On 2 December 2016, the band announced the release of their B-sides and rarities previously unavailable worldwide under the title This Is Everything We Ever Said to celebrate their fifth anniversary as a band.</p>

            <h2 id="modal__title1">Elvis Presley</h2>
            <p id="modal__desc1"><img class="elvisalbum1" src="elvisalbum1.jpg"> Elvis Aaron Presley[a] (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977) was an American singer, songwriter, musician and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the "King of Rock and Roll" or simply "the King".
            Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African American music to a wider audience. Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, Presley was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage the singer for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, "Heartbreak Hotel", was released in January 1956 and became a number one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular—and controversial.</p>
